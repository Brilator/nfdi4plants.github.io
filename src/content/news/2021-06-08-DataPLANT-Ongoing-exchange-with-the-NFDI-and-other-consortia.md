DataPLANT plans to cooperate tightly with the [NFDI4BIOIMAGE](https://nfdi4bioimage.de/en/start/) initiative on imaging data handling. This consortium will apply to the 3rd Call for the NFDI in September. Their central objective is to serve the research community with respect to its research data management (RDM) needs in bioimaging, including microscopy, biophotonics and bioimage informatics. To help them assessing the current situation of RDM in bioimaging, they ask for participation in their anonymous [NFDI4BIOIMAGE Community Survey](https://nfdi4bioimage.de/en/survey/). They welcome contributions from all fields of research at all career levels including research support areas. After evaluation they plan to share the survey results openly with the public.

An other NFDI consortium organizes a virtual workshop on "**RDM in Biophysics**" on **24th July** from 9:00 to 16:00. The workshop will be held as a video conference. Further information as well as workshop registration can be found on [their website](https://indico.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/e/RDMBiophysics). Besides the already confirmed speakers, they welcome additional contributions that address RDM in the field and that trigger discussions. The meeting is a satellite meeting to the [13th EBSA Conference this July in Vienna](https://www.ebsa2021.org/satellite-events), an important meeting for European and worldwide biophysical researchers.
