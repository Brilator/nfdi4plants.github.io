We were glad to finally meet again in person for an ARC Hackathon in the [IBG-4](https://www.fz-juelich.de/de/ibg/ibg-4) of the [Forschungszentrum J端lich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/de). The goal of the event was to work on improving DataPLANTs solution for FAIR data: The Annotated Research Context and its associated tools and services.

Throughout the three-day event at the beginning of October, 26 people not only collaborated on a common goal, but also had the opportunity to explore the Forschungszentrum J端lich. In particular, the guided tour through the greenhouses of [IBG-2](https://www.fz-juelich.de/de/ibg/ibg-2) was a pleasant contrast to the computing-intensive work and simultaneously offering a impression of the world of scientists for many, who we hope to support with the tools and services developed within DataPLANT.

This week we gathered again virtually to give everyone the opportunity to present their progress and collect valuable feedback. From testing our own tools to deploying converters all the way to fundamental design choices, we covered everything. We gained a lot of inspiration, as well as some work to accomplish, though we are already looking forward to the new challenges in front of us.
