title: FAIR together – Launching the Collaboration between the NFDI DataPLANT and the HMC Hub Information
description: The mission of the Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration (HMC) platform and the National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) is to improve the findability (Findable), accessibility (Accessible), machine readability (Interoperable), and reusability (Re-usable) of research data across domains, with respect to the FAIR Principles.

The mission of the [Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration (HMC) platform](https://helmholtz-metadaten.de/de) and the [National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI)](https://www.nfdi.de/) is to improve the findability (Findable), accessibility (Accessible), machine readability (Interoperable), and reusability (Re-usable) of research data across domains, with respect to the FAIR Principles. 

The [HMC Hub Information](https://helmholtz-metadaten.de/de/information/overview) and the NFDI Consortium DataPLANT now starts a direct collaboration at the [Jülich Research Center](https://www.fz-juelich.de/)! 

Starting in June 2021, the HMC Hub Information, located at IAS-9 (Materials and Data Science) under Prof. Stefan Sandfeld, and the NFDI consortium DataPLANT located at [IBG-4](https://www.fz-juelich.de/ibg/ibg-4/DE/Home/home_node.html) under co-spokesperson Prof. Björn Usadel will collaborate in the development of a domain-specific use case. In this collaboration HUB Information will directly contribute to the (further) development of metadata standards and ontologies in the field of plant sciences. The specific solutions developed here will then be broadened, extended, and generalized within the HMC to be incorporated into the cross-domain platform. 

Thus, synergies between NFDI and HMC will be exploited to make our research data FAIR together.
