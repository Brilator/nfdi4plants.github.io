The second NFDI strategy workshop focused on vision, values, mission as
well as on the technical architecture of the NFDI. The workshop was
organized by the NFDI Directorate. In the meantime the association has
been successfully founded and registered. The directorate has also been
completed in terms of personnel. The aim of the workshop was to sharpen
the vision through the participating consortia: Why are we doing this
and what kind of world do we dream of? There was also an exchange about
the values: What are desirable characteristics of the NFDI that are
shared by all members and guarantee responsible action? The mission
should clarify: What are we doing, what is our goal for the NFDI and how
do we want to proceed? The third theme should advance the reflection on
a possible Technical Architecture: How is "the NFDI system" made up of
different components and how do they interact? Because of the actual
situation all was handled online using tools like break-out rooms and
jamboards.
