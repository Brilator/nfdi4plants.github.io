DataPLANT connected with other consortia from the Geo-Chem-Lifesciences field in Bremen on May 27-28. We discussed helpdesks models and support structures to connect and share experiences. Furthermore, a workflow for future collaborations was developed. Thank you to NFDI4Biodiversity for hosting and to NFDI4BIOIMAGE, NFDI4Chem, NFDI4Earth, NFDI4Health, NFDI4Microbiota and FairAgro for the intensive and productive meeting. We look forward to collaborating more closely in the future.
