The first version of the CEPLAS data policy was adopted by the steering committee on February 23rd, 2024. It supports CEPLAS researchers with FAIR data management. We are happy that CEPLAS data management builds on the cooperation with DataPLANT. Research data is organized in form of [Annotated Research Contexts (ARCs)](https://nfdi4plants.org/content/learn-more/annotated-research-context.html) that are stored and shared via the [PlantDataHub](https://git.nfdi4plants.org/ceplas).
