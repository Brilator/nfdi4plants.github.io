The [EOSC Symposium 2024](https://eosc.eu/symposium2024/) (October 21 - 23) is vital to orchestrate activities for research data management (RDM) in Europe. Because of the strong partnership of EOSC and German NFDI program the symposium is a perfect place to mesh infrastructures, architectures, services, use cases, standards and train activities. DataPLANT teamed with further NFDI consortia to suggest an "Unconference Session - Towards a barrier-free research data management in European Plant Science".

Join us for the unconference session at the EOSC symposium 2024 if you:

- seek bundled information on RDM initiatives in plant science
- want to use integrated services around the research data lifecycle in plant sciences from data collection to data analysis and publication
- are a stakeholder in the field of RDM and interested in plant science
- are for looking for networking, collaboration and synergies with national and international RIs
 
A team of leading experts from the (inter)national initiatives ELIXIR (Plant Sciences Community, [ELIXIR-DE](https://elixir-europe.org/)), [de.NBI](https://www.denbi.de/) Service Centers, EOSC ([FAIR-EASE](https://www.fairease.eu/) and [EuroScienceGateway](https://eosc.eu/eu-project/eurosciencegateway)) and NFDI ([FAIRagro](https://fairagro.net/en/) and [DataPLANT](https://www.nfdi4plants.org/)) will present current developments in the areas of data standards and data management processes, FAIR Digital Objects, compute and cloud infrastructures, research data infrastructures, semantic web and data sharing and discuss with you perspectives, short-commings and best practices illustrated by impulse talks.

If you would like to help shape and enhance a shared vision "for accessible research data management in European plant sciences", please express this by voting for this unconference session at the EOSC Symposium 2024!
