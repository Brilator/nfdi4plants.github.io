The Hessian Research Data Infrastructures ([HeFDI](https://www.uni-marburg.de/de/hefdi)) hosted its first virtual [Plenary](https://www.uni-marburg.de/de/hefdi/veranstaltungen/hefdi-plenary-2020) on December 17 last year, and DataPLANT was on board. The primary focus of the event was both cross-site networking of RDM-related groups and illustrating the change about the way data is handled. Especially the inspiring keynote by Prof. Dr. Iris Pigeot from BIPS Bremen, entitled "Data Science and Data Sharing - Mission Impossible without Intelligent Research Data Management?" forced the urgency of well conceived data management. In the subsequent parallel poster sessions, various projects and infrastructure services presented themselves. The [poster introducing DataPLANT](https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=prtt_2225531&client_id=UNIMR) was launched in a breakout session together with the [NFDI4BioDiversity](https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=prtt_2225495&client_id=UNIMR) poster. One of the common challenges faced by the discussing participants was the acquisition and training of qualified personnel especially data stewards The event successfully invited for networking between different consortia and we are looking forward to a next event.
