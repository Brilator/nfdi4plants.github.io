The three day symposium on ARC communication and interoperability took place in Boppard. Besides several DataPLANT colleagues there were also participants from FAIRAGRO, NFDI4BIOIMAGE and NFDI4BIODIVERSITY. The conference created a space for experts of the different NFDIs to interact, discuss and implement, leading to better mutual understanding and greater interoperability between standards and toolings used. After talks and discussions surrounding the ARC ecosystem e.g. how ARCs interoperate with other research data standards implemented in different NFDIs there was hands-on work and collaborative hacking. 

The results are available to the community on Github:
