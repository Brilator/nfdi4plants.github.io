The DataPLANT project team is pleased to inform you that the NFDI expert committee of the DFG has recommended the DataPLANT proposal 
for further funding within the NFDI. The committee has discussed it in a combination of a written procedure and a hybrid session on 
all applications for the continuation of the NFDI consortia from the first round of calls. As a result, the NFDI expert committee of 
the Joint Science Conference (GWK) accepted the nine applications from the first continuation round for further funding. The NFDI 
expert panel's deliberations are based in particular on the results of the review and the applicants' comments on the review results.

As in the first funding phase, the final decision will be final decision will be made by the GWK at its meeting on July 04, 2025. As 
the current agreement between the federal and state governments only covers the period January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2028, funding 
can only be provided for this period. In the informational letter the DFG stated to expect a reduction of the requested funding total 
up to 30%. We hope to receive the concrete information on the further funding in August this year.

We would like to take this positive news as an opportunity to thank you our participants, members and users for your valuable input, 
commitment, cooperation and support. We now have the best possible preconditions for five more successful years with NFDI DataPLANT 
in the plant sciences and beyond.
