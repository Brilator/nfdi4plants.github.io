At the recent RSE meeting of the working group within the Common Infrastructure section of the NFDI, DataPLANT 
had the opportunity to present its development concepts and strategic vision. Central to this presentation were 
the themes of open contribution, collaboration, and the sustainable practices endorsed by our consortium and 
the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI). These themes align closely with the stringent 
requirements set by the DFG and other funding bodies, which are increasingly urging research institutions to 
adopt and promote comprehensive Open Science policies. Such policies include facets like Open Data, Open 
Educational Resources, Open Access, and Open Source.

A notable point of discussion was the NFDI's strong emphasis on Open Source software development, a key criterion 
within its funding framework. The commitment of NFDI consortia to Open Source practices is not just encouragedâ€”it's 
expected. To further this commitment, there is ongoing discussion about creating a unified NFDI recommendation 
that would standardize Open Source practices across various consortia. Sustainability, especially in the realm 
of software development for research data management (RDM) and the underlying basic infrastructure, was 
identified as a crucial objective. DataPLANT has emphasized this focus in its grant proposal for the second 
funding period, explicitly outlining a model for participation and development that supports longevity and 
adaptability.

We have ambitiously set out to establish the principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) 
research data management across our discipline and beyond. In doing so, we aim to empower researchers by instilling 
the principles of Open Science and Open Source into their workflows. A significant focus is placed on the 
qualification of early-career researchers, fostering an environment where meritocracy is strengthened in both 
academic and research settings. This overall strategy not only supports current scientific endeavors but also paves 
the way for future advancements in research methodologies and collaborative initiatives. The proposed concepts 
will be further discussed within the RSE working group and recommendations will be derived.
