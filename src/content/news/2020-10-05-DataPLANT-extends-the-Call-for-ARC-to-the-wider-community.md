The Annotated Research Context (ARC) is a conceptual combination of
experimental data with associated annotation, metadata and description
of computational workflows. It aims both as structuring the workflows on
the local desktop of the user, allow for sharing and versioning and
finally be the base of a data publication. The ARC covers the complete
research cycle and includes experiment data described with the ISA
model, reference knowledge, computational steps like software, code and
scripts as information for the core data repositories on
transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and
phenomics. In DataPLANT the ARCs will be the generic interface for
compute and storage as well as publication and sharing.
