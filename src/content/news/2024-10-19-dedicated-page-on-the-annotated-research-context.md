The Annotated Research Context (ARC) is a framework for organizing and documenting research data, as well 
as a container that continuously supports collaboration, data exchange, and adherence to FAIR principles 
among various researchers. The ARC can be checked for completeness and quality at any time and converted 
into a citable data publication without interrupting the research or documentation process. It is built on 
widely accepted research data standards such as RO-Crate, ISA, and abstract CWL.

DataPLANT seeks to embed Research Data Management (RDM) as a core component of the scientific community beyond its target audience
fostering open development and governance models, embracing the "open-source open-data spirit", treating 
well annotated research data as shared community resources. It partners with further NFDI consortia line 
NFDI4BIOIMAGE and FAIRagro to promote the further development of the ARC to fit into broader application 
beyond fundamental plant research. Thus, the RDM community dedicated web resource 
[ARC-RDM.ORG](https://arc-rdm.org/) got lanched to explain concepts like the data management principle,
tools and services, resources, the ARC data model, representation and (meta)data framework.

ARC implements widely accepted RDM standards, ensuring compatibility with technology-specific endpoints, 
domain-specific databases, search engines, and publication platforms with minimal extra effort. Its 
practical approach blends efficient data organization and documentation, making it easier to publish 
research data that can be transparently referenced in one or more accompanying journal publications. By 
adopting the ARC, researchers can seamlessly engage with the evolving RDM ecosystem, without facing 
barriers or limitations.

The fundamental principle of ARC is to be FAIR by design. It promotes a continuous increase in FAIRness 
through incremental updates and community contributions, making it an evolving system that can grow with 
the needs of researchers. ARCâ€™s collaborative nature, combined with its project management features and 
extensive software support, fosters effective communication and distributed contributions within research 
teams. This makes ARC not only a data management tool but also a powerful platform for collaborative research.

To support the researchers to produce annotated research and connect to international research data management 
activities including workflows and services, DataPLANT provides a tailored ensemble of personal and digital 
technical assistance. DataPLANT Data Stewards are experts in supporting individual researchers in building, 
linking and maintaining the complete research context during data acquisition, curation, analysis, and 
publication. This is supported by providing comprehensive training to ensure data legacy through lectures, 
courses, workshops and summer schools and hackathons.
