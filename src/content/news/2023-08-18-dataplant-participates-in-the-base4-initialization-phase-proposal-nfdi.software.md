title: DataPLANT participates in the Base4 initialization phase proposal nfdi.software
description: Research software plays a major role in RDM besides data. DataPLANT  recognizes this already with the formulation of the ARC specification  taking software and workflows into account as well. To obtain a better  overview within the wide field of research software nfdi.software will  implement a central marketplace. The idea is to enable a seamless access  to the extensive portfolio of research software in the domains of the  different NFDI consortia, for facilitating discovery...

Research software plays a major role in RDM besides data. DataPLANT  recognizes this already with the formulation of the ARC specification  taking software and workflows into account as well. To obtain a better  overview within the wide field of research software nfdi.software will  implement a central marketplace. The idea is to enable a seamless access  to the extensive portfolio of research software in the domains of the  different NFDI consortia, for facilitating discovery, providing context  and documenting maturity of research software, for integrating  information on the relevance, impact, and adoption of software in  communities. This would allow for a connection of research software to  other relevant research outcomes, e.g., publications and data, and  services, e.g., execution platforms. Such a market place leverages the  use of research data made available in the NFDI, and provides a  comprehensive overview of software produced by researchers, research  software engineers, and their organizations, as well as of software  created by the NFDI consortia.    

The main applicant in this Base4NFDI initialization phase proposal is  the Helmholtz-Zentrum Potsdam Deutsches GeoForschungsZentrum GFZ. From  DataPLANT's side we will bring in EOSC expertise via the Galaxy  partnership which is one of the cores of services in our consortium.  Especially in research software is a major factor in digital  souverainity and independence of science.
