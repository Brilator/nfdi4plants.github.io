DataPLANT is organizing monthly ARC user support meetings, [every second Friday of the month from 13:00 to 14:00](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/events/arc-user-support/) on [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_MzFlNzVkOWItYzNjNS00NWMxLWE3ZDUtY2M2YmEwOTk1YWUw%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%229071867c-98f0-4006-89aa-4e4fd55af39d%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%224b7a1c1c-664e-42ce-b224-7599ace27c53%22%7d).

Inspired by the meeting series organized by Sabrina Zander and Dominik Brilhaus in the CEPLAS and MibiNet communities, we are now expanding this meeting to all ARC users.

This meeting is open to all, and the perfect place to get help with creating ARCs for your own data. Data stewards from DataPLANT and associated consortia will be present to discuss your data, how to structure this into the ARC, demonstrate tools and services, and help you with any problems you may encounter when creating your ARC.

For any questions in between these monthly meetings, please join our [Matrix ARC user support chat channel!](https://matrix.to/#/#arc-user-support:matrix.org). You can use Matrix on the web, or install the [Element client](https://element.io/download) for desktop and mobile.
