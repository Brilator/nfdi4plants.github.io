All participants from various Task Areas (TAs) of [NFDI4BIOIMAGE](https://nfdi4bioimage.de/en/start/) and Heinrich Lukas Weil from DataPLANT actively contributed via presentations, hacking, discussion and documentation on four topics. These correspond to various measures in TA3 (and TA1 & TA5) of NFDI4BIOIMAGE comprising [OMERO](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/)-[ARC](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/380251011) interoperability, REMBI and mapping as well as the Neuroglancer.

The NFDI4BIOIMAGE - TA3-Hackathon - UoC-2023 was jointly organized by members of [CECAD Imaging Facility](https://www.cecad.uni-koeln.de/research/core-facilities/imaging-facility), [CEPLAS](https://www.ceplas.eu/de/startseite), [C3RDM](https://fdm.uni-koeln.de/c3rdm-team), [RRZK](https://rrzk.uni-koeln.de/) & [TRR341](https://trr341.uni-koeln.de/) + support from CECAD-IT and RRZK: Eik Dahms, Niraj Kandpal, Astrid Schauss, Andrea Schrader, Monica Valencia-Schneider, Peter Zentis and the TA3 co-lead Torsten Stöter (LIN, Magdeburg) with support from Moritz Hövels and Daniel Wickeroth.

The results are available to the community on Github:

This will serve as the basis to continue the work towards OMERO-ARC interoperability during the de.NBI BioHackathon Germany in December 2023:
