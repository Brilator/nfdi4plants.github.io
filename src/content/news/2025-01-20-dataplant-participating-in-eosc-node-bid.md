title: DataPLANT participates in the NFDI bid on EOSC node services and concepts
description: "One of the main objectives of DataPLANT is to foster a cultural shift toward data publications."

The NFDI is participating in shaping a potential National Node of the EOSC for Germany and is gathering 
candidates for suitable services that could be offered in this context. DataPLANT has submitted a proposal 
containing potential services and concepts. This proposal outlines three possible services or concepts:

The PLANT DataHUB is a fully operational cloud service developed by our consortium, which can be connected 
to various CAAIs (currently the Life Sciences AAI and ORCID, with ongoing collaboration with IAM4NFDI as 
part of Base4). While the service has been in productive use for some time, it continues to be refined 
(e.g., improved workflow integration). Monitoring and other operational features are already implemented, 
which is why we have rated its Technology Readiness Level (TRL) at 9. The service is currently hosted on 
the de.NBI cloud but is designed for easy deployment elsewhere, with open-access installation guides. 
Future support will also be provided through a so-called Service Provider Circle.

Annotated Research Contexts (ARCs) are an implementation of RO-Crate containers for experimental data and 
computational analyses, complete with appropriate metadata annotations. The concept is open to use beyond 
basic plant research and is already being discussed and utilized in FAIRagro and BIOIMAGE. It represents 
a collaborative concept for FAIR data management in the context of the cultural shift toward Open Science 
and Open Data. It ensures that data management is a continuous process of progress and improvement, 
adhering to the principle of being ["immutable yet constantly evolving."](https://10.11588/heibooks.979.c13751) 
The approach is inspired by open-source software principles, emphasizing open participation.

Galaxy is one of the workflow systems utilized in DataPLANT and plays a central role not only in our 
consortium but also in other contexts. Galaxy is made available through the PLANT DataHUB for our 
community.
