On Tuesday, June 29, 2021 from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, the first general member assembly of the National Research Data Infrastructure association (NFDI e.V.) will take place as a virtual event. The objective of the meeting is to elect three scientific members for the Board of Trustees. The election procedure takes place as a general election. The members are entitled to propose persons for the election. This means that members are entitled to nominate persons who participate in a funded consortium or are involved in a binding pre-application for a proposal in 2021, or a non-binding letter of intent to submit a proposal to the DFG in 2021.
