### Content

Developers bring their own code projects or patches to existing tools. We will mostly build on or extend the [ARCtrl](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARCtrl) library.

### Preparation

- Please bring your laptop
- Please familiarize with ARCtrl. ARCtrl docs are available in the [DataPLANT knowledge base](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arctrl/).
