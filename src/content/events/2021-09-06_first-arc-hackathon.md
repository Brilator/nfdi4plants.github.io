## About

The ARC Hackathon offers an incubation space for creativity around the ARC. This includes tooling, teaching, and management. Four major projects are intended to structure our Hackathon and can be extended to include the best ideas. 

DataPLANT members of the different Task Areas come together at Villa Denis in Frankenstein to continue their work on improving DataPLANTs solution for FAIR data. Aside from hacking, there will be a hike through the “Pfälzer Wald” as well as a Pub Quiz.
