## About

You have probably heard about DataPLANT‚Äôs Annotated Research Context (ARC). This three-session workshop series demonstrates the ARC concept and introduces how to build a first ARC for your own research project and annotate the data in your ARC.

## Content

Session 1: Introduction to the ARC (demo)
Session 2: Build your ARC
Session 3: Annotate your data

üí° We will try to record and share sessions with slides afterwards
üë©‚Äçüíª Sessions 2 and 3 are hands-on and require a laptop

## Teaching Materials

Materials are shared via DataPLANT [Knowledge Base](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/docs/teaching-materials/events-2023/2023-05-09_CEPLAS-StartYourARC-Series/index.html).
