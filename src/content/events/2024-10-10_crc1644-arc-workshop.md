## Information

**CRC1644 ARC Workshop**  
*October 10th, 2024*

The CRC 1644 kickoff meeting served as a starting point for the newly formed consortium, bringing together researchers to launch an interdisciplinary effort focused on the mechanisms and evolution of phenotypic plasticity in plants. Of the one full week spanning event, the thursday was alloted to a workshop held by DataPLANT, which provided the CRC 1644 members with practical training on how to generate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data using the ARC (A Research Companion) framework.

The workshop demonstrated how ARCs can streamline research data management, making it easier to document, organize, and share research data across diverse platforms. Attendees were introduced to key ARC features such as process-centered documentation and metadata management, which promote transparency and reusability in data handling. By adopting ARC, CRC 1644 researchers can ensure that their data is not only well-organized but also easily integrated into collaborative projects and accessible for future use.

The hands-on introduction to ARC's tools, such as ARCitect, showcased how researchers can quickly create FAIR-compliant datasets with minimal effort. This, in turn, fosters enhanced collaboration and data sharing within the CRC 1644 community, helping researchers work more efficiently and increase the long-term impact of their findings. Through the adoption of the ARC framework, the consortium is better positioned to address complex biological questions and contribute to cutting-edge plant science.
