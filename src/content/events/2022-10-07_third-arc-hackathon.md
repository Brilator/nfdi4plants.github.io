## About

The ARC Hackathon offers an incubation space for creativity around the ARC. This includes tooling, teaching, and management. Four major projects are intended to structure our Hackathon and can be extended to include the best ideas. 

DataPLANT members of the different Task Areas come together at the Forschungszentrum Jülich to continue their work on improving DataPLANTs solution for FAIR data. Aside from hacking, there will be a guided tour through the greenhouses of the IBG-2 in Jülich.
