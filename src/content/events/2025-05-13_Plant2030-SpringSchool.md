As a participant, you will gain a solid understanding of essential topics in Research Data Management, aligned with the FAIR principles – findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. The course will cover the importance and application of persistent identifiers, data management plans, and legal considerations in plant research. Additionally, you will explore the concept of FAIR digital objects and their practical uses.
Specialized sessions will provide you with valuable skills in RNA-Seq data analysis, protein modeling, and the integration of machine learning and AI technologies into plant science research.

By the end of the course, you will be equipped with foundational knowledge and tools needed to excel in contemporary plant research and data science, preparing you to navigate the challenges of the digital age in your scientific career.

# Registration & Participation

The spring school is designed for early-stage plant scientists, such as master's graduates, PhD students, and early-career post-docs coming from or working in Germany.
Participants should have limited or no prior experience in bioinformatics but be eager to learn and apply bioinformatic tools in their future research. Participants are encouraged to demonstrate active participation and engagement during the spring school.
Registration will open February 11 and close March 13.
During the registration process, you will be asked to provide details about your background and education, along with a brief motivation letter outlining your expectations for the course. These details form the basis for selecting the participants in order to facilitate a suitable course.
Maximum number of participants is 15. In case the number of persons enrolled exceeds the capacity of the event, people working on BMBF funded projects will be prioritized.

# Organization

The spring school takes place at IPK Gatersleben, May 13-16, 2025, noon to noon.
Participants are asked to bring their own laptops.
The spring school is free of charge. However, participants are responsible for covering their own travel and accommodation expenses.
We have reserved a block of hotel rooms in Quedlinburg that can be booked if desired.
Transportation between Quedlinburg and IPK Gatersleben is organized.
Social events during the spring school will provide opportunities for exchange and networking.
