# About

You have probably heard about DataPLANT's **[Annotated Research Context](https://nfdi4plants.org/content/learn-more/annotated-research-context.html)** (ARC). This two-session workshop series demonstrates the ARC concept and introduces how to build a first ARC for your own research project and annotate the data in your ARC.

# Preparation !

1. For the **hands-on** blocks you will need a **laptop with functioning wifi access on HHU campus** (e.g. [Eduroam](https://www.zim.hhu.de/servicekatalog/netze/wlan))
2. Please follow the [preparation slides](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/docs/teaching-materials/disseminations/2023-09-MibiNet-CEPLAS-StartYourARC/index.html) to setup required tools on your laptop
3. We offer an online tech-check meeting on **September 18th at 1pm**: [Meeting link](https://hhu.webex.com/hhu-en/j.php?MTID=m7d5f61cc9da2036cae1ae8926b14b62f)
    - This is optional to help you with above setup
    - If you run into issues with tool setup, but cannot make it to the tech-check, please come to the workshop half an hour earlier.
4. :coffee: **Please bring your own coffee mug!** We will serve coffee and tea, but do not have a dish washer. :smiley:
