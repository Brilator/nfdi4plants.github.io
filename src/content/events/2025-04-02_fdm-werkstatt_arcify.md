This hands-on workshop introduces the concept of the Annotated Research Context (ARC) – DataPLANT’s implementation of a Fair Digital Object (FDO). Learn how to use the tool ARCitect to create ARCs (https://arc-rdm.org) for your datasets, annotate them with metadata and share them via the DataHUB (https://git.nfdi4plants.org).

### Target Group

- Participants may have little to no experience in coding or programming
- While the workshop is designed around demo data from plant sciences, the tools are likewise adoptable in other (natural) sciences

### Requirements

- Requires a laptop with ARCitect (https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arcitect/) installed
- Please sign up for a DataPLANT user account (https://register.nfdi4plants.org/) in advance of the workshop
An online tech-check meeting is offered on March 25th, 14:00 - 14:30 via [this link](https://hhu.webex.com/hhu-en/j.php?MTID=mddbf047d4df65dab822886b1aaa01b9d).
