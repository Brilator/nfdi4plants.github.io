DataPLANT develops advanced research data management (RDM) concepts tailored specifically to the needs of the plant research community, offering a comprehensive framework that supports the entire data lifecycle.
Central to this model are Data Stewards, who provide expert guidance and training, and Embedded Data Stewards, who integrate within individual research consortia to offer localized support.
These stewards play a key role in helping researchers adopt FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data practices by providing tools, services, and hands-on assistance.
DataPLANTâ€™s resources, such as the ARC structure and PLANTdataHUB, enable plant scientists to efficiently manage, annotate, and share their data, ensuring it is organized, curated, and accessible for future research and collaboration.
