The **ARC Data Hub concept** applies principles from software development to the research data management (RDM) framework provided by ARCs, making ARCs first-class citizens in the cloud.
DataPLANT also provides a central reference implementation, the **PLANTDataHUB**.

The PLANTdataHUB is a cloud-based platform designed for the collaborative storage, management, and sharing of research data in the plant science community.
It handles large datasets and adds specialized research data management (RDM) services to support the evolving needs of researchers.
By hosting Annotated Research Contexts (ARCs), the platform provides a structured and transparent way to store experimental data, metadata, and analyses, ensuring compatibility with international RDM standards like RO-Crate FAIR digital objects.
The PLANTdataHUB promotes open, FAIR data practices while eliminating technical lock-in, fostering long-term accessibility and reuse.
