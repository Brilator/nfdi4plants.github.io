title: DataPLANT Governance

The DataPLANT consortium has developed a participatory model where members play a key role in broadening its diversity. 
In its daily operation, DataPLANT does not differentiate between the initial community and its significantly broadened user base. 
To align community needs with technical expertise aggregated within task areas (TAs) and national and international RDM activities, we will establish Focus Areas (FAs) that span the task areas, facilitating the implementation of overarching objectives, namely Education & Best Practices, Community Interaction, Engagement and Sustainability and (Inter)National Integration. 
DataPLANT’s board structure is set to evolve towards an “open board policy” with broad and inclusive participation. 
The Steering Committee will add three elected community members, and four Focus Area Leads besides the task areas leads. 
The international Advisory Board will consist of international professionals external to DataPLANT, who are appointed due to their expertise in RDM. 
DataPLANT implements an organizational model designed for long-term, community-enabled sustainability. 
By implementing an open participation and contribution model, the foundations are laid for open science and self-governance.
