description: Overview of the DataPLANT Task Areas
---

## Task Area 1

_Data Quality, Standardization, Interoperability_ 

Will provide support, including AI-based approaches, to facilitate the collection of vocabularies and ontologies, encouraging broader community participation.
TA1 will enhance ontologies embedded within international consortia, which are essential for improving data and workflow interoperability and ensuring AI-readiness through machine actionability. 
This will connect user documentation, technical endpoints, workflow engines, and domain-specific requirements. 
To guarantee high-quality (meta)data, TA1 will implement automated validation processes, supplemented by a community-driven data publication review system. 
Furthermore, TA1 will promote RDM practices through the involvement of data stewards, fostering a culture of traceability within the community.

## Task Area 2
_Infrastructure, Service, and Workflow Platform_

Will enhance the DataPLANT DataHUB and associated services to ensure deep integration with both national and international infrastructures. 
This includes platforms such as the NFDI Research Data Commons, OpenAIRE, EOSC, and EBI. 
These efforts aim to improve the visibility and recognition of DataPLANT by journals, the NFDI, the EU, and key international RDM initiatives and stakeholders. 
Task Area 2 supports efficient data management and analysis, enabling the execution of actionable FAIR Digital Objects (FDOs) within established workflow environments. 
It will leverage consortium cloud environments and the NFDI FAIR data spaces to implement an infrastructure-as-a-service model for distribution and maintenance.

## Task Area 3

_Software, Application, and Transfer_ 

Will promote an open-source culture, encouraging participation and skill development in research data projects and software. 
TA3 will foster community engagement by offering personalized support through tailored digital assistance. 
It will also refine and consolidate the plant FAIR Digital Object (FDO) software stack to enhance interoperability with other NFDI and international RDM services. 
TA3 will provide open educational resources and implement a "train the trainer" model to support the embedded data steward approach. 
This will include the development of improved documentation, tutorials, and teaching materials, empowering active community participation through transparent, community-driven feedback and development processes. 
Additionally, TA3 will establish a support framework for embedded and geo-distributed data stewards.

## Task Area 4

_Coordination and Management_ 

Will focus on efficiently managing the consortium and ensuring alignment with community-driven objectives. 
TA4 will coordinate the dissemination of project information and outcomes from all task areas, ensuring that all stakeholders, both within and outside the consortium, are well-informed. 
It will also establish bidirectional advocacy structures and create low-barrier participation opportunities for the broader community and beyond. 
Additionally, TA4 will form special interest groups for the life sciences (LS), address legal matters, represent the consortium in dealings with the DFG, and foster collaboration among state-level initiatives, compute centers, faculty IT, research institutions, libraries, and NFDI liaison efforts to drive consolidation.
