description: Overview of the DataPLANT Task Areas
---

## Task Area 1

_Data Quality, Standardization, Interoperability_ 

Will promote topics such as data quality assurance, interoperability and standardization including AI-based approaches, to facilitate the collection of vocabularies and ontologies, encouraging broader community participation. The task area will further its efforts to enhance data and workflow interoperability, focusing on semantic understandability and machine actionability to maximize user benefits. Central to this effort is the ongoing support and development of a standardized annotation principle. This principle bridges user documentation with specific technological endpoints, workflow engines, domain-specific requirements, search engines, and data indexing services, thereby improving data FAIRness. Expert assistance will be provided for the collection and management of missing vocabulary needed for metadata
annotation, tailored to community needs and encouraging active participation. To ensure the quality of (meta)data, we will implement automatic validation processes that support an envisioned journal-like peer-review system for data publication. Additionally, we will promote RDM practices that support a culture of error acknowledgment within the community.

These efforts will be conducted to strengthen and coordinate standardization efforts in plant research-related data and workflow annotation and will be closely linked with other relevant NFDIs nationally, and e.g. ELIXIR, EOSC, IPPN, MIAPPE, and RO-Crate internationally.

## Task Area 2
_Infrastructure, Service, and Workflow Platform_

Will enhance the DataPLANT DataHUB and associated services to ensure deep integration with both national and international infrastructures. 
This includes platforms such as the NFDI Research Data Commons, OpenAIRE, EOSC, and EBI. 
These efforts aim to improve the visibility and recognition of DataPLANT by journals, the NFDI, the EU, and key international RDM initiatives and stakeholders. 
Task Area 2 supports efficient data management and analysis, enabling the execution of actionable FAIR Digital Objects (FDOs) within established workflow environments. 
It will leverage consortium cloud environments and the NFDI FAIR data spaces to implement an infrastructure-as-a-service model for distribution and maintenance.

## Task Area 3

_Software, Application, and Transfer_ 

Will promote an open-source culture, encouraging participation and skill development in research data projects and software. 
TA3 will foster community engagement by offering personalized support through tailored digital assistance. 
It will also refine and consolidate the plant FAIR Digital Object (FDO) software stack to enhance interoperability with other NFDI and international RDM services. 
TA3 will provide open educational resources and implement a "train the trainer" model to support the embedded data steward approach. 
This will include the development of improved documentation, tutorials, and teaching materials, empowering active community participation through transparent, community-driven feedback and development processes. 
Additionally, TA3 will establish a support framework for embedded and geo-distributed data stewards.

## Task Area 4

_Coordination and Management_ 

Will focus on efficiently managing the consortium and ensuring alignment with community-driven objectives. 
TA4 will coordinate the dissemination of project information and outcomes from all task areas, ensuring that all stakeholders, both within and outside the consortium, are well-informed. 
It will also establish bidirectional advocacy structures and create low-barrier participation opportunities for the broader community and beyond. 
Additionally, TA4 will form special interest groups for the life sciences (LS), address legal matters, represent the consortium in dealings with the DFG, and foster collaboration among state-level initiatives, compute centers, faculty IT, research institutions, libraries, and NFDI liaison efforts to drive consolidation.
