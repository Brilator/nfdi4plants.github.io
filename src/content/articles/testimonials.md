## Partner: Cluster of Excellence on Plant Sciences (CEPLAS)

> Collaboration and integrating large research datasets are central to the mission of CEPLAS. With a diverse research landscape across four institutions, CEPLAS demands a robust, sustainable data management system. ARC and the DataHUB provide a flexible, adaptable environment for managing and annotating diverse data types, enabling seamless collaboration across institutions and ensuring structured, controlled data exchange both within CEPLAS and with external partners. This empowers us to collaborate efficiently from data acquisition through integration with internationally recognized systems.

## Partner: Collaborative Research Centre 1535 (MibiNet)

> At MibiNet, effective collaboration and data sharing across institutions are crucial for advancing microbial network research. With teams across several universities, we rely on ARC and the DataHUB to manage, annotate, and share complex datasets securely. The platform's community templates support standardized annotation, ensuring detailed metadata essential for microbial studies. This approach simplifies data integration and exchange within MibiNet and with external partners, while also streamlining the publication of high-quality datasets, accelerating scientific progress.
