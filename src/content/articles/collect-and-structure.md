title: Create, structure and fill your ARCs
description: Our tools ARCitect and ARCCommander simplify the creation, structuring and maintenance of ARCs.

The ARCitect and ARCCommander are two essential tools developed by DataPLANT that assist users with the creation and management of ARCs.
ARCitect employs a graphical user interface to guide researchers in creating, organizing, and annotating research data, ensuring adherence to FAIR principles.
ARCCommander complements ARCitect by offering robust management capabilities via the command line.
By initializing a new ARC using ARCitect or ARCCommander, the ARC folder structure, including studies, assays, workflows and runs as well as subfolders is constructed.
ISA metadata files are automatically added to each study and assay and can be easily filled using the same tools.
The tools provide structured assistance and automation with processes following the ARC specification.
ARCitect and ARCCommander initialize your ARC as a git repository, allowing you to track changes of your ARC.
The tools can also be used to back-up and synchronize your ARC with the DataHUB as well as to download and modify ARCs from the DataHUB.
Managing data throughout the research lifecycle is thus simplified.
