Data management plans (DMPs) describe the handling of research data throughout its whole lifecycle and are required with project proposals by most funding agencies.
To streamline the creation of DMPs for plant scientists, DataPLANT developed the DMP Generator DataPLAN as a web-based tool.
Tailored to the needs of researchers in plant science, DataPLAN provides a user-friendly interface that guides scientists through the process of creating comprehensive, FAIR-compliant DMPs.
It provides templates fitting the DMP requirements of different funders, like DFG, Horizon Europe, or BMBF, making it easier for researchers to meet compliance obligations.
In addition to presenting the respective questions to be answered, DataPLAN also comprises pre-written text blocks as answers.
These answers in part depend on the selections, e.g. of data types to be generated, made by the users. Any required free text information is asked for in the form of simple questions and automatically integrated into the text at the necessary positions.


By integrating established standards and protocols, DataPLAN ensures that essential aspects such as data collection, storage, sharing, and long-term preservation are fully addressed.
Researchers are prompted to detail how their data will be documented, how it will be made accessible for future use, and what measures will be taken to safeguard its integrity and security.
All templates prepared and provided by DataPLAN are customizable, allowing users to create plans that fit both small-scale studies and large, collaborative research efforts.
