title: The ARC Data Hub concept
description: ""
---

The **ARC Data Hub concept** applies the software development principles of _Continuous Integration (CI)_ and _Continuous Deployment (CD)_ to the research data management (RDM) framework provided by ARCs, making ARCs first-class citizens in the cloud.
ARCs can be continuously validated, built, and deployed much like software.
By using CI/CD for a set of subsequently defined tasks, many collaborative cloud platforms such as GitLab, GitHub, or Bitbucket can be used to build an ARC Data Hub.

The concept is [explained in detail in this paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/tpj.16474)

The ARC Data Hubs of DataPLANT serve as central repositories where research data and associated metadata are stored in the form of [**A**nnotated **R**esearch **C**ontexts (**ARC**s)](https://arc-rdm.org).
All Data Hubs offer robust version control features, allowing users full authority over access and interaction with their research data.
Each ARC Data Hub implementation includes backup strategies to ensure the stored data is safeguarded.

DataPLANT offers two primary DataHUB nodes: the [PLANTdataHUB](https://git.nfdi4plants.org/) and the [DataHUB (federated)](https://gitlab.nfdi4plants.de/), both accessible to the entire plant science community.
Additionally, there are on-premise implementations designed for specific sub-communities.
All DataHUBs are equipped with backup and sustainability measures to ensure data safety and long-term availability.
