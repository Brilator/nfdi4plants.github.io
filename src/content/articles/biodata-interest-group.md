In a Memorandum of Understanding, DataPLANT, NFDI4Biodiversity and NFDI4Microbiota agree to work more closely together in order to better align their offerings for the management of biological data.

> “The preliminary work of the three consortia complements each other perfectly. Thanks to the now formalized, closer cooperation, we can support researchers in the field of biology even better and make it easier for them to access data, services and resources.” The spokespersons of DataPLANT, NFDI4Biodiversity and NFDI4Microbiota

## Scope of the Memorandum of Understanding
Although the participating consortia cover different subject areas and research contexts (field/laboratory), the target groups addressed have much in common: They all work with biological data and use similar data types and methods.

The collaboration agreed in August 2024 aims to harmonize the research data management strategies of the three consortia for different research contexts and thus facilitate access to services and other data-related resources in the field of biology.

At the same time, the even closer cooperation as a so-called Biodata Interest Group should generate synergy effects and pool the consortia's resources in a meaningful way. Coordinated activities have been agreed in the following areas:

- Training and further education
- Service portfolio (reuse and joint development of services)
- Public relations and communication
- User support
- Activities in the UN policy arena in relation to digital sequence information.

The future Biodata Interest Group aims to initially consolidate the approaches developed with the specialist communities of the individual consortia. As the preliminary work regarding the services, guidelines, use cases and training offers complement each other very well and the consortia have already gained some experience in the implementation of joint projects, the conditions for this are ideal.

The Interest Group is open to cooperation with other specialist NFDI consortia.

## About the consortia
DataPLANT, NFDI4Biodiversity and NFDI4Microbiota are part of the [National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI)](https://www.nfdi.de/?lang=en) launched by the federal and state governments in 2018, which systematically opens up valuable scientific and research data for the entire German scientific system and across all disciplines, networks them and makes them usable in a sustainable and qualitative manner.

[DataPLANT](https://www.nfdi4plants.org/) provides plant science researchers with easily accessible and user-oriented services and tools for the management, processing and publication of data packages at an early stage of the research process. The overarching goal of the consortium is to provide scientists with an infrastructure that facilitates and supports collaborative research in plant biology.

![Logo NFDI4Biodiversity](src/assets/images/articles/NFDI_4_Biodiversity_Logo.svg)
[NFDI4Biodiversity](https://www.nfdi4biodiversity.org/en/) offers researchers and other data enthusiasts extensive resources for working with biodiversity, ecology and environmental data. In addition, it sees itself as an expert network that provides its users with a wide range of support services. In the first funding phase (2021-2025), the foundations will be laid for a common infrastructure and data mobilization according to the FAIR principles, with a focus on occurrence and metabarcoding data.

[NFDI4Microbiota](https://nfdi4microbiota.de/) supports microbiology researchers with a wide range of solutions and services to make their data and other research results open and FAIR. The versatile offerings include data management training, data storage solutions, data analysis services and research data management consulting.

## Data types
The target groups of the consortia work with similar data types, which is why the services, support and training offers developed so far complement each other perfectly.

The following data types have been a particular focus of the consortia's first funding phase to date:

|Data Type                                             | DataPLANT| NFDI4Biodiversity | NFDI4Microbiota|
| :--------------------------------------------------- | :------- | :---------------- | :--------------|
| **Type 1**: Collection data, species occurrence data | -        | +++               | -              |
| **Type 2**: Taxon data                               | -        | +++               | +              |
| **Type 3**: biological and ecological study data     | +        | +                 | +              |
| **Type 4**: non-molecular analysis data              | +++      | +                 | +++            |
| **Type 5**: molecular sequence data                  | +++      | ++                | +++            |

**Legend**: +++ high priority, ++solid priority, + not so much in focus, - no priority so far.

## Joint activities and fields of work
The consortia will set up a Biodata Interest Group within the NFDI to steer joint activities and involve other consortia over time. The aim is to coordinate operational goals and also to carry out joint public relations work in order to reach the common target groups even better. There are also plans to cooperate across consortia in order to jointly drive forward the development of key services and guarantee the sustainable financing of biodata services.

**Joint partner institutions and employees**

In order to further strengthen the partnership between the three consortia, there will be joint co-applicant institutions and employees with a view to the upcoming second funding phases from 2025/2026. A list of the current partner institutions can be found in the annex to the published letter of intent.

**Joint digital infrastructure**

The consortia rely on cooperation with the [de.NBI](https://www.denbi.de/) service centers and the cloud and have a common interest in driving the further development of the de.NBI infrastructure to meet the needs of their target communities. They will also provide new use cases to work with de.NBI to sharpen its portfolio for research data infrastructure providers in the life sciences. The latter will be facilitated by the de.NBI cloud providers that are joint members of the consortia. In addition, there is a shared interest in multicloud technologies and the concept of the Research Data Commons. This is being jointly promoted as part of the ongoing negotiations on the NFDI architecture and basic services.

**Joint programming work for services and standards**

The consortia will develop cross-consortium Flexfunds projects and use cases, e.g. in relation to the use of the Annotated Research Context (ARC) in biodiversity research groups, the use of the ontology repositories BiodivPortal and Bioportal as well as TS4NFDI, the joint development of tools for the collection of metrics on service use and the implementation of bioschemas.org by data and service providers in the consortia. The use cases are used to further develop services in various specialist areas and to plan cross-consortium workshops and seasonal schools.
