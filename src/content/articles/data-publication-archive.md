ARChigator is a tool for submitting ARCs hosted on DataHUB for publication in the ARChive. 
Only ARCs that pass continuous quality control are eligible for submission. 
ARChigator also acts as a last-stop preview of record metadata. 
When submitting an ARC, ARChigator will display the metadata record that will be used for the data publication. 
This allows for a last manual check if the metadata is correct and complete before submitting the ARC. 
Once submitted via ARCigator, ARCs are submitted as a request for publication (RFP) to the ARChive. 
Once an ARC is in RFP stage, emails are sent to the addresses registered in the ARCs metadata that contain a link to the ARCs publication status update page. 
RFPs are reviewed by the ARChive's editorial board, which might request changes to certain metadata entries to meet our quality criteria. 
If the RFP is accepted, the ARC is published and a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is minted for the ARC via DataCite.
