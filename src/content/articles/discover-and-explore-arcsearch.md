The ARCSearch is a tool for integrated search and analysis of individual ARCs and experimental metadata. 
The web-based user interface provides a consolidated real-time view of the public ARCs within the DataPLANT community as well as of a user's private ARCs after log-in. 
The search functions of the ARC Registry application enable users to explore the ARCs and their assay data based on keywords and metadata. 
The users can look up the ARCs by specific keywords, such as the working group they are interested in, the ARC creator or by the title of the ARC. 
Most importantly, the users can also search and explore the experimental metadata from various ARCs simultaneously, thus, paving the way toward cross-omics metadata exploration within the community.
