## Local Development

- we recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as editor, as there is an official [astro extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode) for it.
- if not installed already, install [node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en)
- clone this repo
- run `npm install`.
  This installs the packages used in this project.
  You might have to run this command again if new packages are added.
- run `npm run dev`.
  This starts a local development server.
  You can access the page at http://localhost:4321/ The server will automatically reload the page when you make changes to the files in the `src` directory.
